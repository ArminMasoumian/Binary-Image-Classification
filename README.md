# Binary Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

This repository contains an implementation of a binary image classification model using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in PyTorch. The model is trained and evaluated on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The task is to classify each image as either a cat or a dog.

##Requirements

Python 3.7 or higher
PyTorch 1.9 or higher
